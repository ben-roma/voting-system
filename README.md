# Blockchain-based Voting System

## Overview

This project is a **Blockchain-based Voting System** designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. The system leverages blockchain technology to record and store votes in a decentralized ledger, ensuring that each vote is immutable and can be audited by authorized entities.

The system is built using **React** for the frontend, **Node.js** with **Express** for the backend, **Solidity** for smart contracts, **Ganache** for local blockchain simulation, and **MongoDB** for managing voter and candidate data.

## Features

- **Voter Registration**: Users can register to vote using their National Identification Number (NIP), password, and OTP.
- **Authentication**: The system uses secure authentication methods to ensure only registered voters can participate.
- **Vote Casting**: Voters can securely cast their vote for their preferred candidates.
- **Real-time Results**: Results can be viewed in real-time once the voting period has ended.
- **Vote Tamper Resistance**: Every vote is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and resistance to tampering or fraud.
- **Admin Management**: Admins can manage voter registration, candidates, and election results.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Ganache, and Web3.js
- **Database**: MongoDB for voter and candidate data
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Smart Contract Management**: Truffle

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) (optional for browser-based blockchain interaction)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vote-system.git
   cd vote-system

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install

3. **Start MongoDB Make sure MongoDB is running locally**
    ```bash
    mongod

4. **Start Ganache Launch Ganache to simulate the local blockchain**

5. **Compile and Migrate Smart Contracts**
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate

6. **Run the Application Start the backend server and Fontend**
    ```bash
    npm run start:backend
    npm run start:frontend


7. **Access the Application The application will be running at http://localhost:3000**

## Usage

- Voter Registration: Navigate to the registration page to create a new voter profile.
- Vote Casting: Once authenticated, you can cast your vote for the available candidates.
- Admin Management: Admins can manage voters, candidates, and results through the admin dashboard.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with National ID Systems**: Plan to integrate with national ID systems for voter identity verification.
- **Mobile App Support**: Extend the system to mobile devices for easier access.
- **Smart Contract Optimization**: Improve gas efficiency and scalability of smart contracts.
